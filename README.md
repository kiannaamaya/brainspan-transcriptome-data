# Overview

## Features
- **Baseline Classifiers**: Implementation of basic ML classifiers such as OneVsRestClassifier with XGBClassifier, SVC, and MLPClassifier.
- **Baseline Regressors**: Usage of RandomForestRegressor, LinearRegression, SVR, XGBRegressor, and MLPRegressor for regression tasks.
- **Custom CNN Models**: Development of CNN models for both classification and regression purposes.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: Implementation of GNNs for both classification and regression, with plans to migrate to DGL and PyG frameworks.
- **Late Fusion Models**: Initial exploration of late fusion techniques, currently applied to baseline classifiers.

## Future Goals
- **Expand Late Fusion Techniques**: Extend the application of late fusion methods beyond the initial baseline classifiers.
- **Enhance GNN Models**: Transition to advanced GNN frameworks like DGL (Deep Graph Library) and PyG (PyTorch Geometric) for improved performance and capabilities.
- **Further Model Development and Evaluation**: Continuous refinement and evaluation of all models to enhance accuracy.
